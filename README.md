"People who bought also bought....."
This is what Association Rule Learning help us figure out. Model used is Apriori. 

In this project, connection between food items purchased is shown using methods i.e. Support, Confidence and Lift. It basically recommends that if a person has bought "whole wheat pasta" then according to the data obtained, person is most likely to buy "olive oil" next.

Outputs are obtained according to decreasing order of Lift. If Lift is high, then possibility of purchasing connected item is high.
